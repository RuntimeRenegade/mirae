- [x] 3. Set up React Native cache layer architecture
  - Implement dual-layer caching strategy (memory-first, AsyncStorage fallback)
  - Create singleton pattern for cache managers to ensure consistency across React Native app
  - Set up proper TypeScript interfaces for cache items and management
  - Add cache key generation with age-group specificity for React Native storage
