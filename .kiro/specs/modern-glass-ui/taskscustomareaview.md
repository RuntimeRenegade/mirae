  - Add video state management with loading, playback, and seek capabilities
  - Create seamless looping mechanism with smart position handling
  - Implement video synchronization and smooth transitions for React Native
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 2.3 Add React Native video performance optimizations
  - Create debounced seek operations to prevent rapid seek calls
  - Implement safe seek functions with comprehensive error handling

  - Write performance monitoring for video memory usage in React Native
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 3. Set up React Native responsive design and breathing effects
  - Implement responsive height calculations using responsive-dimensions
  - Create dynamic opacity breathing effect animation for visual elements
  - Set up flexible layout system that adapts to different React Native screen sizes
  - Add proper z-index layering for video backgrounds and content overlay
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Implement React Native animation and visual effects
- [x] 4.1 Create breathing opacity animation system
  - Build smooth opacity animation using setInterval with math-based curves
  - Implement configurable animation speed and opacity ranges
  - Add animation lifecycle management with proper cleanup
  - Create visual breathing effect for enhanced user experience in React Native
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 4.2 Add React Native border and styling system
  - Implement iOS-specific border styling with custom colors and widths
  - Create responsive border radius and gradient effects
  - Add proper styling for status bar and bottom safe area backgrounds
  - Ensure consistent visual hierarchy across different React Native screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4.3 Implement React Native video overlay and positioning
  - Add precise video positioning using negative margins and responsive calculations
  - Create proper video overlay system that doesn't interfere with content
  - Implement video opacity management for seamless background integration
  - Optimize video rendering performance for smooth React Native animations
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Add React Native error handling and platform compatibility
- [x] 5.1 Implement React Native platform-specific rendering
  - Create iOS-specific safe area implementation with proper inset handling
  - Add Android fallback that uses standard React Native View without video
  - Implement graceful degradation when Expo Video is not available
  - Write comprehensive error boundaries for video playback failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 4.2_

- [x] 5.2 Add React Native video error recovery and fallback
  - Implement video loading timeout and retry mechanisms
  - Create fallback rendering when video assets fail to load
  - Add error logging and debugging utilities for video playback issues
  - Ensure app stability when video components encounter errors in React Native
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 6. React Native CustomSafeAreaView testing and cross-platform validation
  - Test video playback performance across different React Native device capabilities
  - Validate safe area calculations on various iOS device screen sizes
  - Perform cross-platform testing ensuring Android fallback works correctly
  - Conduct React Native memory usage testing with video background components
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.1, 4.2_
