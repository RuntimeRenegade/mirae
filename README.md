## **Current Platform Capabilities**

> **Current State**: Mirae is a production-ready platform that generates personalized, interactive storybooks for children aged 6-12. Our AI engine creates complete, professionally-authored books in minutes, featuring the child as the protagonist alongside diverse characters in immersive, educational adventures.

### **What Mirae Delivers Today**

Mirae represents a breakthrough in personalized children's literature, combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with proven storytelling methodologies to create unique, interactive storybooks that place each child at the center of their own adventure. Unlike traditional children's books or basic story generators, Mirae produces complete, professionally-authored narratives that rival the quality of published children's literature while incorporating advanced personalization and interactive learning features.

The current Story Generation styles available can deliver stories that many of us adults cherished ourselves as children, maybe your child didn't take interest in the same stories we used to love, however Mirae makes it possible to generate stories with similiar writing styles yet modern design and of course your kid as a character!

<summary><strong>How Kiro was used </strong></summary>

<br>

**KIRO COMING IN CLUTCH**

The hackathon for Kiro honestly gave me the boost I needed to start a new project, we all know how daunting it is starting from scratch and although I have many boiler plates I typically style in a dark theme which made me feel like I would have a lot of work ahead of me. Seeing the hackathon for Kiro I was excited to utilize it on getting the project off the ground.

Kiro was instrumental in helping me rapidly architect and implement the modern glass UI and convert core Mirae components to React Native. The detailed implementation plansâ€”see `.kiro/specs/modern-glass-ui/tasksglass.md` and `.kiro/specs/modern-glass-ui/tasksmiraeconversion.md`â€”were generated and refined using Kiro, guiding everything from the glass theme system, component library, and app structure, to the conversion of Mirae's web features for mobile. This allowed me to:
- Build a consistent glass-morphism design system with custom themes and effects
- Create reusable glass components (GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassInput) with animation, accessibility, and performance optimizations
- Set up robust routing, error boundaries, and responsive layouts for mobile
- Convert and optimize all major Mirae features (library, onboarding, story creation, reading, learning, art, and utility components) for React Native
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility, accessibility, and high performance

Kiro's planning and automation made it possible to deliver a polished, production-ready experience much faster than manual planning alone.

However changes were made due to Expo 54 coming out with Liquid Glass therefore changes were made and the glass components aren't being used, but it got me off to a great start and the web components to react native component conversions were paramount in making this happen!

### **Current Steps to Generate**

The creation process goes as follows:  

1. **Enter Character Details**  
   - User enters a name, chooses gender, selects an age between **6â€“12**, and may optionally upload a picture to be part of the story.  
   - The image is **never saved** to a database â€” it is validated immediately before the process begins.  
   - The user can save the character for future use.  

2. **Select Writing Style**  
   - **Ages 6â€“8:** Styles inspired by current, well-known childrenâ€™s authors.  
   - **Ages 9â€“12:** Popular formats such as *Dear Diary*, *Heroâ€™s Journal*, or *Choose Your Path*.  

3. **Choose an Art Style**  
   - Popular styles include *pixel-inspired*, *voxel*, *dropship guardians*, and *classic art styles*.  
   - The amount of art generated depends on the age group and book type.  
   - Typically, ages **6â€“8** will have **at least 10 images** (not including the cover).  

4. **Pick the Story Setting**  
   - Each age group has **20+ unique settings** to choose from.  

5. **Choose a Friend for the Journey**  
   - Different friends available per age group, with **200+ options per group** (*~500 total*).  

6. **Choose a Hero for the Journey**  
   - Works the same as choosing a friend, with the same number of options.  

7. **Confirm Story Selection & Token Use**  
   - The user confirms their selections and uses tokens to save the story for generation.  

8. **Generate the Book**  
   - The book is created in the userâ€™s **Enchanted Library**, and within minutes they receive an **immersive, one-of-a-kind story**.

Through riddles, feather-traps, and quick thinking, Zara teaches Nimbus a lesson in kindness and sharing. Justice is served with a whiffle of wind and a whoosh of laughter.
